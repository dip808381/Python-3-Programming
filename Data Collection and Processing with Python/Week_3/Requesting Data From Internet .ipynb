    "# More Details of Response objects\n",
    "Once we run requests.get, a python object is returned. It’s an instance of a class called Response that is defined in the requests module. We won’t look at it’s definition. Think of it as analogous to the Turtle class. Each instance of the class has some attributes; different instances have different values for the same attribute. All instances can also invoke certain methods that are defined for the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Runestone environment, we have a very limited version of the requests module available. The Response object has only two attributes that are set, and one method that can be invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The .text attribute. It contains the contents of the file or other information available from the url (or sometimes an error message).\n",
    "\n",
    "The .url attribute. We will see later that requests.get takes an optional second parameter that is used to add some characters to the end of the base url that is the first parameter. The .url attribute displays the full url that was generated from the input parameters. It can be helpful for debugging purposes; you can print out the URL, paste it into a browser, and see exactly what was returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The .json() method. This converts the text into a python list or dictionary, by passing the contents of the .text attribute to the jsons.loads function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full Requests module provides some additional attributes in the Response object. These are not implemented in the Runestone environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The .status_code attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a server thinks that it is sending back what was requested, it sends the code 200.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the requested page doesn’t exist, it sends back code 404, which is sometimes described as “File Not Found”.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the page has moved to a different location, it sends back code 301 and a different URL where the client is supposed to retrieve from. In the full implementation of the requests module, the get function is so smart that when it gets a 301, it looks at the new url and fetches it. For example, github redirects all requests using http to the corresponding page using https (the secure http protocol). Thus, when we ask for http://github.com/presnick/runestone, github sends back a 301 code and the url https://github.com/presnick/runestone. The requests.get function then fetches the other url.

    "\n",
    "For example, in the following, the base url is https://google.com/search. A dictionary with two parameters is passed. Thus, the whole url is that base url, plus a question mark, “?”, plus a “q=…” and a “tbm=…” separated by an “&”. In other words, the final url that is visited is https://www.google.com/search?q=%22violins+and+guitars%22&tbm=isch. Actually, because dictionary keys are unordered in python, the final url might sometimes have the encoded key-value pairs in the other order: https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=%22violins+and+guitars%22. Fortunately, most websites that accept URL parameters in this form will accept the key-value pairs in any order."

    "# Caching Response Content\n",
    "You haven’t experienced it yet, but if you get complicated data back from a REST API, it may take you many tries to compose and debug code that processes that data in the way that you want. (See the Nested Data chapter.) It is a good practice, for many reasons, not to keep contacting a REST API to re-request the same data every time you run your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid re-requesting the same data, we will use a programming pattern known as caching. It works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing some expensive operation (like calling requests.get to get data from a REST API), check whether you have already saved (“cached”) the results that would be generated by making that request.\n",
    "\n",
    "If so, return that same data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If not, perform the expensive operation and save (“cache”) the results (e.g. the complicated data) in your cache so you won’t have to perform it again the next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you go on to learn about web development, you’ll find that you encounter caching all the time – if you’ve ever had the experience of seeing old data when you go to a website and thinking, “Huh, that’s weird, it should really be different now… why am I still seeing that?” that happens because the browser has accessed a cached version of the site.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are at least four reasons why caching is a good idea during your software development using REST APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "It reduces load on the website that is providing you data. It is always nice to be courteous when using other people’s resources. Moreover, some websites impose rate limits: for example, after 15 requests in a 15 minute period, the site may start sending error responses. That will be confusing and annoying for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will make your program run faster. Connections over the Internet can take a few seconds, or even tens of seconds, if you are requesting a lot of data. It might not seem like much, but debugging is a lot easier when you can make a change in your program, run it, and get an almost instant response.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is harder to debug the code that processes complicated data if the content that is coming back can change on each run of your code. It’s amazing to be able to write programs that fetch real-time data like the available iTunes podcasts or the latest tweets from Twitter. But it can be hard to debug that code if you are having problems that only occur on certain Tweets (e.g. those in foreign languages). When you encounter problematic data, it’s helpful if you save a copy and can debug your program working on that saved, static copy of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easier to run automated tests on code that retrieves data if the data can never change, for the same reasons it is helpful for debugging. In fact, we rely on use of cached data in the automated tests that check your code in exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some downsides to caching data – for example, if you always want to find out when data has changed, and your default is to rely on already-cached data, then you have a problem. However, when you’re working on developing code that will work, caching is worth the tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The requests_with_caching module\n",
    "In this book, we are providing a special module, called request_with_caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you’ll use this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code will include a statement to import the module, import requests_with_caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of invoking requests.get(), you’ll invoke requests_with_caching.get().\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll get exactly the same Response object back that you would have gotten. But you’ll also get a printout in the output window with one of the following three diagnostic messages:\n",
    "\n",
    "found in permanent cache\n",
    "\n",
    "found in page-specific cache\n",
    "\n",
    "new; adding to cache\n",
    "\n",
    "The permanent cache is contained in a file that is built into the textbook. Your program can use its contents but can’t add to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The page-specific cache is a new file that is created the first time you make a request for a url that wasn’t in the permanent cache. Each subsequent request for a new url results in more data being written to the page-specific cache. After you run an activecode that adds something to the page-specific cache, you’ll see a little window below it where you can inspect the contents of the page-specific cache. When you reload the webpage, that page-specific cache will be gone; hence the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of other optional parameters for the function requests_with_caching.get().\n",
    "\n",
    "cache_file– it’s value should be a string specifying the name of the file containing the permanent cache. If you don’t specify anything, the default value is “permanent_cache.txt”. For the datamuse API, we’ve provide a cache in a file called datamuse_cache.txt. It just contains the saved response to the query for “https://api.datamuse.com/words?rel_rhy=funny”.\n",
    "\n",
    "private_keys_to_ignore– its value should be a list of strings. These are keys from the parameters dictionary that should be ignored when deciding whether the current request matches a previous request. The main purpose of this is that it allows us to return a result from the cache for some REST APIs that would otherwise require you to provide an API key in order to make a request. By default, it is set to [“api_key”], which is a query parameter used with the flickr API. You should not need to set this optional parameter."
