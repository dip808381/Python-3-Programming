    "# Checking Assumptions About Data Types\n",
    "Unlike some other programming languages, the python interpreter does not enforce restrictions about the data types of objects that can be bound to particular variables. For example, in java, before assigning a value to a variable, the program would include a declaration of what type of value (integer, float, Boolean, etc.) that the variable is allowed to hold. The variable x in a python program can be bound to an integer at one point and to a list at some other point in the program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "That flexibility makes it easier to get started with programming in python. Sometimes, however, type checking could alert us that something has gone wrong in our program execution. If we are assuming at that x is a list, but it’s actually an integer, then at some point later in the program execution, there will probably be an error. We can add assert statements that will cause an error to be flagged sooner rather than later, which might make it a lot easier to debug.\n",

    "# Writing Test Cases for Functions\n",
    "It is a good idea to write one or more test cases for each function that you define.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function defines an operation that can be performed. If the function takes one or more parameters, it is supposed to work properly on a variety of possible inputs. Each test case will check whether the function works properly on one set of possible inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful function will do some combination of three things, given its input parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a value. For these, you will write return value tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the contents of some mutable object, like a list or dictionary. For these you will write side effect tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Print something or write something to a file. Tests of whether a function generates the right printed output are beyond the scope of this testing framework; you won’t write these tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Return Value Tests\n",
    "Testing whether a function returns the correct value is the easiest test case to define. You simply check whether the result of invoking the function on a particular input produces the particular output that you expect. If f is your function, and you think that it should transform inputs x and y into output z, then you could write a test as assert f(x, y) == z. Or, to give a more concrete example, if you have a function square, you could have a test case assert square(3) ==  9. Call this a return value test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because each test checks whether a function works properly on specific inputs, the test cases will never be complete: in principle, a function might work properly on all the inputs that are tested in the test cases, but still not work properly on some other inputs. That’s where the art of defining test cases comes in: you try to find specific inputs that are representative of all the important kinds of inputs that might ever be passed to the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first test case that you define for a function should be an “easy” case, one that is prototypical of the kinds of inputs the function is supposed to handle. Additional test cases should handle “extreme” or unusual inputs, sometimes called edge cases. For example, if you are defining the “square” function, the first, easy case, might be an input like 3. Additional extreme or unusual inputs around which you create test cases might be a negative number, 0, and a floating point number.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think about how to generate edge cases is to think in terms of equivalence classes of the different kinds of inputs the function might get. For example, the input to the square function could be either positive or negative. We then choose an input from each of these classes. It is important to have at least one test for each equivalence class of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic errors are often caused by improperly handling the boundaries between equivalence classes. The boundary for this problem is zero. It is important to have a test at each boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think about edge cases is to imagine things that could go wrong in the implementation. For example, in the square function we might mistakenly use addition instead of multiplication. Thus, we shouldn’t rely on a test that uses 2 as input, but we might be fooled into thinking it was working when it produced an output of 4, when it was really doubling rather than squaring.\n",

This function takes a string called letters and updates the counts in counts_diction that are associated with each character in the string. To do a side effect test, we first create a dictionary with initial counts for some letters. Then we invoke the function. Then we test that the dictionary has the correct counts for some letters (those correct counts are computed manually when we write the test.

In the browser ActiveCode windows, you get an error message in a box below. When you are executing python programs from the command-line, you also get an error message saying something about what went wrong and what line it occurred on.

    "# When to use try/except\n",
    "The reason to use try/except is when you have a code block to execute that will sometimes run correctly and sometimes not, depending on conditions you can’t foresee at the time you’re writing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when you are running code that fetches data from a website, you may run the code when you don’t have a network connection or when the external website is temporarily not responding. If your program can still do something useful in those situations, you would like to handle the exception and have the rest of your code execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "As another example, suppose you have fetched some nested data from a website into a dictionary d. When you try to extract specific elements, some may be missing: d may not include a particular key, for example. If you anticipate a particular key potentially not being present, you could write an if..else check to take care of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "if somekey in d:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # it's there; extract the data\n",
    "    \n",
    "    extract_data(d)\n",
    "    \n",
    "else:\n",
    "\n",
    "    skip_this_one(d)\n",
    "    \n",
    "However, if you’re extracting lots of different data, it can get tedious to check for all of them. You can wrap all the data extraction in a try/except.\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "\n",
    "    extract_data(d)\n",
    "    \n",
    "except:\n",
    "\n",
    "    skip_this_one(d)\n",
    "    \n",
    "It’s considered poor practice to catch all exceptions this way. Instead, python provides a mechanism to specify just certain kinds of exceptions that you’ll catch (for example, just catching exceptions of type KeyError, which happens when a key is missing from a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    extract_data(d)\n",
    "    \n",
    "except KeyError:\n",
    "\n",
    "    skip_this_one(d)\n",
    "    \n",
