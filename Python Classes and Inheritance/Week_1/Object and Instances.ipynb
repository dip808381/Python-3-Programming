    "### Object-oriented programming\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented programming language. That means it provides features that support object-oriented programming (OOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming has its roots in the 1960s, but it wasn’t until the mid 1980s that it became the main programming paradigm used in the creation of new software. It was developed as a way to handle the rapidly increasing size and complexity of software systems and to make it easier to modify these large and complex systems over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now, some of the programs we have been writing use a procedural programming paradigm. In procedural programming the focus is on writing functions or procedures which operate on data. In object-oriented programming the focus is on the creation of objects which contain both data and functionality together. Usually, each object definition corresponds to some object or concept in the real world and the functions that operate on that object correspond to the ways real-world objects interact."

    "# User Defined Classes\n",
    "We’ve already seen classes like str, int, float and list. These were defined by Python and made available for us to use. However, in many cases when we are solving problems we need to create data objects that are related to the problem we are trying to solve. We need to create our own classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider the concept of a mathematical point. In two dimensions, a point is two numbers (coordinates) that are treated collectively as a single object. Points are often written in parentheses with a comma separating the coordinates. For example, (0, 0) represents the origin, and (x, y) represents the point x units to the right and y units up from the origin. This (x,y) is the state of the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking about our diagram above, we could draw a point object as shown here.\n",
    "\n",
    "A point has an x and a y\n",
    "Some of the typical operations that one associates with points might be to ask the point for its x coordinate, getX, or to ask for its y coordinate, getY. You would want these types of functions available to prevent accidental changes to these instance variables since doing so would allow you to view the values without accessing them directly. You may also wish to calculate the distance of a point from the origin, or the distance of a point from another point, or find the midpoint between two points, or answer the question as to whether a point falls within a given rectangle or circle. We’ll shortly see how we can organize these together with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A point also has methods\n",
    "Now that we understand what a point object might look like, we can define a new class. We’ll want our points to each have an x and a y attribute, so our first class definition looks like this.\n",
    "\n",

    "        self.x = 0\n",
    "        self.y = 0\n",
    "Class definitions can appear anywhere in a program, but they are usually near the beginning (after the import statements). The syntax rules for a class definition are the same as for other compound statements. There is a header which begins with the keyword, class, followed by the name of the class, and ending with a colon.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the first line after the class header is a string, it becomes the docstring of the class, and will be recognized by various tools. (This is also the way docstrings work in functions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every class should have a method with the special name __init__. This initializer method, often referred to as the constructor, is automatically called whenever a new instance of Point is created. It gives the programmer the opportunity to set up the attributes required within the new instance by giving them their initial state values. The self parameter (you could choose any other name, but nobody ever does!) is automatically set to reference the newly created object that needs to be initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let’s use our new Point class now. This next part should look a little familiar, if you remember some of the syntax for how we created instances of the Turtle class, in the chapter on Turtle graphics.\n",

We can add methods to the Point class that are sensible operations for points. Had we chosen to use a tuple to represent the point, we would not have this capability. Creating a class like Point brings an exceptional amount of “organizational power” to our programs, and to our thinking. We can group together the sensible operations, and the kinds of data they apply to, and each instance of the class can have its own state.\n",

For example, with a list bound to variable L, L.append(7) calls the function append, with the list itself as the first parameter and 7 as the second parameter. Methods are accessed using dot notation. This is why L.append(7) has 2 parameters even though you may think it only has one: the list stored in the variable L is the first parameter value and 7 is the second.\n",

One thing to notice is that even though the getX method does not need any other parameter information to do its work, there is still one formal parameter, self. As we stated earlier, all methods defined in a class that operate on objects of that class will have self as their first parameter. Again, this serves as a reference to the object itself which in turn gives access to the state data inside the object."

In this case, because distance is really a property of a pair of points and is symmetric (the distance from a to b is the same as that from b to a) it makes more sense to have it be a standalone function and not a method.

The sounds instance variable is initialized to be a copy of the class variable with the same name. The reason we make a copy of the list is that we will perform destructive operations (appending new sounds to the list). If we didn’t make a copy, then those destructive operations would affect the list that the class variable points to, and thus teaching a sound to any of the pets would teach it to all instances of the class!\n",
