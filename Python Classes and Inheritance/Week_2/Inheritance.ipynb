    "# Introduction: Class Inheritance\n",
    "Classes can “inherit” methods and class variables from other classes. We’ll see the mechanics of how this works in subsequent sections. First, however, let’s motivate why this might be valuable. It turns out that inheritance doesn’t let you do anything that you couldn’t do without it, but it makes some things a lot more elegant. You will also find it’s useful when someone else has defined a class in a module or library, and you just want to override a few things without having to reimplement everything they’ve done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider our Tamagotchi game. Suppose we wanted to make some different kinds of pets that have the same structure as other pets, but have some different attributes or behave a little differently. For example, suppose that dog pets should show their emotional state a little differently than cats or act differently when they are hungry or when they are asked to fetch something.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could implement this by making an instance variable for the pet type and dispatching on that instance variable in various methods."

    "# Inheriting Variables and Methods\n",
    "# Mechanics of Defining a Subclass\n",
    "We said that inheritance provides us a more elegant way of, for example, creating Dog and Cat types, rather than making a very complex Pet class. In the abstract, this is pretty intuitive: all pets have certain things, but dogs are different from cats, which are different from birds. Going a step further, a Collie dog is different from a Labrador dog, for example. Inheritance provides us with an easy and elegant way to represent these differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, it works by defining a new class, and using a special syntax to show what the new sub-class inherits from a super-class. So if you wanted to define a Dog class as a special kind of Pet, you would say that the Dog type inherits from the Pet type. In the definition of the inherited class, you only need to specify the methods and instance variables that are different from the parent class (the parent class, or the superclass, is what we may call the class that is inherited from. In the example we’re discussing, Pet would be the superclass of Dog or Cat).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example. Say we want to define a class Cat that inherits from Pet. Assume we have the Pet class that we defined earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want the Cat type to be exactly the same as Pet, except we want the sound cats to start out knowing “meow” instead of “mrrp”, and we want the Cat class to have its own special method called chasing_rats, which only Cat s have.\n",

However, since we are not invoking the method the normal way, with <obj>.methodname, we have to explicitly pass an instance as the first parameter.
