    "Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeated execution of a sequence of statements is called iteration. Because iteration is so common, Python provides several language features to make it easier. We’ve already seen the for statement in a previous chapter. This is a very common form of iteration in Python. In this chapter we are going to look at the while statement — another way to have your program do iteration."

    "# The while Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another Python statement that can also be used to build an iteration. It is called the while statement. The while statement provides a much more general mechanism for iterating. Similar to the if statement, it uses a boolean expression to control the flow of execution. The body of while will be repeated as long as the controlling boolean expression evaluates to True.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following two figures show the flow of control. The first focuses on the flow inside the while loop and the second shows the while loop in context.\n",
    "\n",
    "a diamond at the top has the phrase \"Is the condition True?\". Two arrows come out it with either the phrase yes or no on the arrows. The yes arrow points to a box that says \"evaluate the statemenets in the body of the loop\". It then has an arrow that unconditionally points back to \"Is the condition True?\" diamond. The no arrow escapes the loop and points down past the \"evaluate\" square.image showing a rectangle with \"code block\" written on it on top. Then, text that read \"while {condition}\": followed by an indented block with \"run if {condition} is True\" written on it. An arrow points from the bottom of the indented block to the top of the while loop and says \"run loop again\". At the bottom of the image is an unindented block that says the phrase \"code block.\"\n",
    "We can use the while loop to create any type of iteration we wish, including anything that we have previously done with a for loop. For example, the program in the previous section could be rewritten using while. Instead of relying on the range function to produce the numbers for our summation, we will need to produce them ourselves. To do this, we will create a variable called aNumber and initialize it to 1, the first number in the summation. Every iteration will add aNumber to the running total until all the values have been used. In order to control the iteration, we must create a boolean expression that evaluates to True as long as we want to keep adding values to our running total. In this case, as long as aNumber is less than or equal to the bound, we should keep going."

Since having it always return True would not be a good idea we will write our version to decide randomly.

    "# Introduction: Optional Parameters\n",
    "In the treatment of functions so far, each function definition specifies zero or more formal parameters and each function invocation provides exactly that many values. Sometimes it is convenient to have optional parameters that can be specified or omitted. When an optional parameter is omitted from a function invocation, the formal parameter is bound to a default value. When the optional parameter is included, then the formal parameter is bound to the value provided. Optional parameters are convenient when a function is almost always used in a simple way, but it’s nice to allow it to be used in a more complex way, with non-default values specified for the optional parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider, for example, the int function, which you have used previously. Its first parameter, which is required, specifies the object that you wish to convert to an integer. For example, if you call in on a string, int(\"100\"), the return value will be the integer 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s the most common way programmers want to convert strings to integers. Sometimes, however, they are working with numbers in some other “base” rather than base 10. For example, in base 8, the rightmost digit is ones, the next digit to the left is 8s, and the one to the left of that is the 64s place (8**2).\n",
    "\n",
    "The int function provides an optional parameter for the base. When it is not specified, the number is converted to an integer assuming the original number was in base 10. We say that 10 is the default value. So int(\"100\") is the same as invoking int(\"100\", 10). We can override the default of 10 by supplying a different value."
