    "# What we can do with Turtles and Conditionals\n",
    "So far, our programs have either been a series of statements which always execute sequentially or operations that are applied to each item in an iterable. Yet programs frequently need to be more subtle with their behavior. For example, a messaging app might only set a message’s title bold if it has not been read by the user. Or a video game needs to update the position of all the characters that are not asleep. This is done with something called a selection or a conditional statement.\n",

Next we want one of two actions to happen, either amy should move right and then forward, or left and then forward. The direction that we want her to go in depends on her pen color. If her pen color is set to pink - which is determined by writing amy.pencolor() == \"Pink\" which checks to see if the value returned by amy.pencolor() is the equivalent to the string “Pink” - then we should have her move right and forward. Else (or otherwise) she should move left and forward. Both things can’t happen though. She can’t move right, forward and left, forward. We then do the same thing for kenji, though in this case, we didn’t change kenji’s pen color.\n",
