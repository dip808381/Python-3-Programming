    "# Introduction: Iteration\n",
    "A basic building block of all programs is to be able to repeat some code over and over again. Whether it is updating the bank balances of millions of customers each night, or sending email messages to thousands of people programming involves instructing the computer to do many repetitive actions. In computing, we refer to this repetitive execution as iteration. In this section, we will explore some mechanisms for basic iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "With collections (lists and strings), a lot of computations involve processing one item at a time. For strings, this means that we would like to process one character at a time. Often we start at the beginning, select each character in turn, do something to it, and continue until the end. For example, we could take each character and substitute for the character 13 characters away in the alphabet to create a coded message.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern of processing is called a traversal, or iteration over the characters. Similarly, we can process each of the items in a list, one at a time, iterating over the items in the list. This has applications in every piece of software you can imagine:\n",

    "Each image (grid of pixels) has its own width and its own height. The width is the number of columns and the height is the number of rows. We can name the pixels in the grid by using the column number and row number. However, it is very important to remember that computer scientists like to start counting with 0! This means that if there are 20 rows, they will be named 0,1,2, and so on through 19. This will be very useful later when we iterate using range."

This technique for creating color is known as the RGB Color Model. The amount of each color, sometimes called the intensity of the color, allows us to have very fine control over the resulting color.\n",

    "The minimum intensity value for a basic color is 0. For example if the red intensity is 0, then there is no red in the pixel. The maximum intensity is 255. This means that there are actually 256 different amounts of intensity for each basic color. Since there are three basic colors, that means that you can create 2563 distinct colors using the RGB Color Model.\n",
    "In the example below, we first create a pixel with 45 units of red, 76 units of green, and 200 units of blue. We then print the current amount of red, change the amount of red, and finally, set the amount of blue to be the same as the current amount of green."
