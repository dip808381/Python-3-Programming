    "Introduction: Sequences\n",
    "In the real world most of the data we care about doesn’t exist on its own. Usually data is in the form of some kind of collection or sequence. For example, a grocery list helps us keep track of the individual food items we need to buy, and our todo list organizes the things we need to do each day. Notice that both the grocery list and the todo list are not even concerned with numbers as much as they are concerned with words. This is true of much of our daily life, and so Python provides us with many features to work with lists of all kinds of objects (numbers, words, etc.) as well as special kind of sequence, the character string, which you can think of as a sequence of individual letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have seen built-in types like: int, float, and str. int and float are considered to be simple or primitive or atomic data types because their values are not composed of any smaller parts. They cannot be broken down.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, strings and lists are different from the others because they are made up of smaller pieces. In the case of strings, they are made up of smaller strings each containing one character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types that are comprised of smaller pieces are called collection data types. Depending on what we are doing, we may want to treat a collection data type as a single entity (the whole), or we may want to access its parts. This ambiguity is useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will examine operations that can be performed on sequences, such as picking out individual elements or subsequences (called slices) or computing their length. In addition, we’ll examine some special functions that are defined only for strings, and we’ll find out one importance difference between strings and lists, that lists can be changed (or mutated) while strings are immutable.\n",

    "## Strings and Lists\n",
    "Throughout the first chapters of this book we have used strings to represent words or phrases that we wanted to print out. Our definition was simple: a string is simply some characters inside quotes. In this chapter we explore strings in much more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we explore lists, which are very much like strings but can hold different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings can be defined as sequential collections of characters. This means that the individual characters that make up a string are in a particular order from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "A string that contains no characters, often referred to as the empty string, is still considered to be a string. It is simply a sequence of zero characters and is represented by ‘’ or “” (two single or two double quotes with nothing in between).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "A list is a sequential collection of Python data values, where each value is identified by an index. The values that make up a list are called its elements. Lists are similar to strings, which are ordered collections of characters, except that the elements of a list can have any type and for any one list, the items can be of different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to create a new list. The simplest is to enclose the elements in square brackets ( [ and ]).\n",
    "\n",
    "[10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
    "[\"spam\", \"bungee\", \"swallow\"]\n",
    "The first example is a list of four integers. The second is a list of three strings. As we said above, the elements of a list don’t have to be the same type. The following list contains a string, a float, an integer, and another list.\n",
    "\n",
    "[\"hello\", 2.0, 5, [10, 20]]\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "WP: Don’t Mix Types!\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll likely see us do this in the textbook to give you odd combinations, but when you create lists you should generally not mix types together. A list of just strings or just integers or just floats is generally easier to deal with.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tuples\n",
    "A tuple, like a list, is a sequence of items of any type. The printed representation of a tuple is a comma-separated sequence of values, enclosed in parentheses. In other words, the representation is just like lists, except with parentheses () instead of square brackets [].\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to create a tuple is to write an expression, enclosed in parentheses, that consists of multiple other expressions, separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "julia = (\"Julia\", \"Roberts\", 1967, \"Duplicity\", 2009, \"Actress\", \"Atlanta, Georgia\")\n",
    "The key difference between lists and tuples is that a tuple is immutable, meaning that its contents can’t be changed after the tuple is created. We will examine the mutability of lists in detail in the chapter on Mutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a tuple with a single element (but you’re probably not likely to do that too often), we have to include the final comma, because without the final comma, Python treats the (5) below as an integer in parentheses:\n",

    "## Index Operator: Accessing Elements of a List or Tuple\n",

We use the index operator ( [] – not to be confused with an empty list). The expression inside the brackets specifies the index. Remember that the indices start at 0. Any integer expression can be used as an index and as with strings, negative index values will locate items from the right instead of from the left.\n",
